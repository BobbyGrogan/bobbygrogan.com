                This is some personal things about me and my consumption rather than production interests. What you will find here will tell you more spesifically about me than any social media account would. I like being trasparent about random personal interests.

I like poetry that plays with words by rhyming. I like poetry which seems proud of the human condition and confident in the individual. Most importantly, I like poems which are written with passion and desire.</div>

I have started many more books than are on this list becuase I tend to put down ones which become uninteresting. I also always want to read more, but I tend to find myself drawn into my computer more strongly than paper- which may or may not be best.</div>

I tend to like indie musicians the most, but my taste covers all genres I can think of. My favorite band is Gang of Youths. My favorite song of theirs is "Keep Me In The Open." My top song in 2022 was "Flapper Girl" by the Lumineers. In 2021 it was "Angel of Small Death and the Codeine Scene," by Hozier. In 2020 it was "Riptide" by Vance Joy.</div>

                        <div class="item-desc text-color">I started playing chess a lot my senior year of high school. I joined the chess team and competed with the team at the State competition. I would guess my peak actual ELO is 1300, but I have no FIDE ranking. My highest chess.com ELO was 1550 in rapid. Lichess ELOs are definitely inflated, so I don't think my skill is reflected there. I think Lichess has a beautiful UI and I love that it tracks your stats and games.</div>
