                I first started coding with Python in 2019. I got my own computer in the summer of 2020 and began using Ubuntu as my primary operating system shortly after. I bought a couple domains and a hosting plan in eary 2021. I have worked on various projects since.

                    <div class="item-desc text-color">This is by far my most extensive project. An explanation can be found on the sites about page. Essentially I like discovering new websites, so I made a site which directs users to random sites. I used simple PHP post requests to communicate with the MySQL database. I have approximately 5000 sites in my database. The site collects logs details about each visitor and collects user ratings if they submit them. Users can also create accounts where they can track their history and save sites as favorites.</div>

I was curious how many file extensions I could name and how many other people could. I created this from scratch with Javascript. I used a couple sources online to find as many file extensions as I could, but I am sure some are not included.</div>
