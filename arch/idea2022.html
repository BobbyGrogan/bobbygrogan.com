<p style="text-align: center;">IDEA stands for Illinois Drafting Educators Association. There are about half a dozen events which one can compete in for this orginization. I competed in 3D Architectural Modeling. This is the first time I did IDEA, but my school goes every year. The following is the small house that I was instructed to build. I was very happy with this project since I had lots of time to put in details. The one glaring mistake is that I changed the exterior wall material on the 3D view without Roof but not on the other one (it should've been changed on both). The sink also clipping into the countertop, whoops.<span style="font-size:18px;"> </span></p>
