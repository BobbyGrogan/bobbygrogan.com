                In high school I pursued a strong interest in architecture. Thanks to my teacher, Mr. Molinari, I was able to gain advanced proficency in Revit, a 3D Modeling CAD software. These are some buildings I designed.

I figured I would use my architecture skills to demonstrate my interest by designing a building based off one of theirs. Cocke hall is an academic building on the main quad of UVA. This project invloved designing of detailed components which I used for the doors, columns, and sweeps. I also did some basic landscaping. This project was rendered to an extremely high quality.</div>

I was dissapointed that this prompt was very boring. In fact it was the same prompt which was given a few years before, so I had practiced with it before. Most people found it difficult to fit all the required views onto the proper size sheet, and I think I was the only one to properly include all deliverables on the right sheet. I was happy to win again.</div>

This was an 8 hour competition held virtually against the winners from other states. I had lots of fun working on this. It essentially was a project which would take 2 months in class which we were told to finish in a day. There was a solid amount of creative leeway, so I exercised that. I had the best floor plan and elavations among competitors, but roof plan and site plan were lacking. I placed 3rd.</div>

We were given an unorthadox prompt, to design a trailer home with certain spesifications. Since we had only ever practiced designing larger buildings, this was unique. I had so much fun working on this 3 hour design challenge that I wrote about it for my college Common App essay.</div>

IDEA is typically more competitive than SkillsUSA. The prompt was for garage with a studio above. As you'll see on the sheet, the 3D views are different. In the last second I realized the exterior front wall of the second wall was supposed to be a different color, but I didn't do it correctly.</div>
